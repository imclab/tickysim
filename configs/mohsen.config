		#              wrap-around. This topology is the one intended for large
		#              real-world SpiNNaker systems. The size of the network is
		#              specified by the torus_width/torus_height parameters.
		#   "mesh" -- A "rectangular" hexagonal mesh network where each node (except
		#             those on the edges) has six links. Links at the edge of the
		#             mesh do not wrap around. The width and height can be specified
		#             by the mesh_width/mesh_height parameters.
		#   "board_mesh" -- A "hexagonal" hexagonal mesh network where each node
		#                   (except those on the edges) has six links. The nodes are
		#                   arranged in a hexagon as in the SpiNNaker boards. This
		#                   topology is the one used by single board SpiNNaker
		#                   systems. The size of the network is defined by the
